# Welcome

Welcome to to **Soramitsu Khmer**'s frontend team. This should be the starting point for any new team members. Before joining the team, you will need spend some time focussing on skills relevant to your teams.

Here are some documents to help you get started:

## Getting Started

If it's your first day today, we'd just like you to know how happy we are to have you with us :)

To give you an idea of what to expect from your **on-boarding** experience, we have written this short guide. It covers the things that we think are important for new starters and we hope it provides a basis for your successful on-boarding.

Please visit [Frontend handbook](https://github.com/soramitsukhmer/frontend-handbook) for more getting started guide and documentations. And visit [Resources](https://github.com/soramitsukhmer/frontend-resources#readme) to find our in-house built components and libraries.
